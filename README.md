GROMP is a  League of Legends's website that focus's heavily on the users champions mastery. We move away from the norm of showing you your K:D Ratio, and try to push you
in a more social direction, with achievable end goals that you can be proud to reach and tweet about.

This website has been created as a submission for Riot's **[API Challenge 2016](https://developer.riotgames.com/)**.
